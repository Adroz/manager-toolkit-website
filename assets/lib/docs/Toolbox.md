### Tools Used
Slack, JIRA, Confluence (NOTE: previously GDocs, and either tool will work the same)
# Communication
## Meetings
_Weekly kickoff meeting_ - plan out the week. Get everyone focused on what's important this week.
_Standups and textups_ - keep people accountable and keep yourself in the loop. Two standups per week, and three textups is a good blend.
_QA bugs and backlog triage_ - a weekly meeting to look through the backlog of bug items to be triaged (prioritized). Once immediate bugs have been addressed, time can be spent prioritizing older bugs/work items.
_Trifecta/Leads meeting_ - a weekly meeting for leads from each stream (Engineering, Product, Design) to discuss process, progress, strategy updates. This meeting type should also be used for engineering management across features/teams.
## Slack
When forming a new team, it‚Äôs advantageous to separate engineering and stakeholder concerns. What‚Äôs worked with me at PlanGrid is:
* _#team-name_ - For support, sales, platform QA, external engineering teams
* üîí _team-name-eng_ - Team Engineering, QA, Product, Design
* üîí _team-name-textup_ - A textup channel with daily reminders (based on standup/textup split)
## Email
For larger teams (>5) think about setting up an email group following the Slack channel naming format - _team-name@domain.com_.

## Directs
### Holidays
Holiday time should be tracked (use HR‚Äôs tool if possible, otherwise roll your own). Even with ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù vacation it‚Äôs a good idea to see who‚Äôs abusing the policy, who‚Äôs going to a lot of conferences/sick/etc. By tracking you can get forewarning about people burning themselves out, too.
Another tool to help could be to sync all report‚Äôs OOO/Holiday calendar events into a new calendar. See this [link](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/articles/vacation-calendar) (note: it only works with Google calendars).
### 1:1s
1:1s every week for each direct report, for 30mins (studies show weekly 1:1s are most effective).
* Status update - 10min `TODO: would like to phase this out`
* Share-out from me - 10min
* +/-'s of the week. Things that are helping/harming productivity and enjoyment.
* Action Items
### Career/performance sync
Every 6 weeks have a recurring career-focused meeting (in a conference room). The check-in should give ICs time to course-correct. If you‚Äôre doing it right there should be no surprises come review time, and most of the hard work for you should be done.

Goals of the sync | Anti-goals
----------------- | ----------
Provide a way for people to get concrete feedback about where they stand.<br>Provide concrete things people can do to grow.<br>Create a record of contributions and improvements to review during promo cycles.<br>Prevent surprises during promo cycles.<br>Keep this flexible enough to work with different types of people, changing goals, and changing company needs. | Encourage people to game the ladder.<br>Create more work for managers.<br>Encourage ICs to focus on things that don‚Äôt help the company. 

Meeting format, loosely based on [this](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-care-professionally-personally-for-team/steps/structure-career-conversations-with-grow/):

Goals | Reality | Work in Progress
----- | ------- | ----------------
What do you want to be doing today?<br>What do you want to be doing in 1 year?<br>What do you want to be doing in 3 years?<br>What do you want to be doing in 8 years? | What is currently holding you back?<br>What are you good at that you can do more of?<br>What skills from the ladder would you like to focus on improving over the next 6 months?<br>What sort of opportunities are you looking for? | What will you do in the next 6 months to get closer to your goals?<br>What help will you need to get to those goals?<br>How will we know that you're on track?<br>What have you done so far?

### Reviews
When performing reviews:
* Provide constructive feedback
* Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDoes this situation/issue‚Ä¶‚Äù
	* Hinder their (or the team‚Äôs) performance?
	* Reflect poorly on them (or the team)?
	* Prevent them from growing/excelling in their current role?
* Plan out how to progress
* Initial career-focused meeting can go over previous peer/personal levels
* Ladder walk through
* Level-set
## You
Set up office hours - most people won‚Äôt use them, but it will mean you‚Äôll have some private time and you can use it to consolidate notes on your reports and/or prep for 1:1s/career meetings.
Pick a champion/tech lead - might make sense on a per-project basis? They can own the tech spec and the launch of features.

### Recruiting
https://pca.st/925v
### Sell call (typically first call, 30mins)
Typical call pattern:
* 2mins - Who I am, what my team is, what it‚Äôs focused on.
* 5mins - How about then - what are they doing with themselves? (who do they work for, what‚Äôs their product, etc).
* 5mins - What‚Äôs something technically interesting you‚Äôve worked on?
	* Dig in more, as needed. Ask questions.
* 3mins - What do you want for your next role? Any particular frameworks etc that you‚Äôre wanting to work on. (Explain how we meet that)
* 2mins - How much do you know about the company? - Explain it out a bit for them.
* 3mins - Any more questions?
### Technical Screen

### In-person Interviewing
As a manager you‚Äôll most likely be hosting the behavioral interview.
```Behavioral interview - You‚Äôll be looking at a key few areas
Looking for concrete examples on how they interacted with their team/conflict resolution/etc.
Mentally flexible and adaptable
Able to adapt and move around teams
Where are you in the job search.
How excited, etc
```
### Close-out
**Giving an offer** - Let them know everyone liked them and why they did. Tell them we‚Äôre excited to extend them an offer. A good tactic when give them an offer is to be clear that you want them on the team and you‚Äôre willing to work with them to get them to join. Something like: 
>‚ÄúFrom this point I'm no longer the person judging you. We want you on the team, and I'll do what I can to have you join. Recruiting will call you as a follow up, but let me know what you need to get you in the door.‚Äù

Agree to look into their requests and pass that on to Recruited to work on a compensation package. Let them know they can call you back with more questions and you can provide them with the emails of those who had interviewed them, so they can ask their future peers questions.

**Rejecting the candidate** - Call them to let them know you‚Äôre not extending an offer (don‚Äôt make them wait, and don‚Äôt do it over email). Thank them for their time and wish them well on their search. If they ask for feedback you can try to call out what they failed to demonstrate in the interview, or you can use a more canned response: 
>‚ÄúThat's just not something I do unfortunately. Hiring is a really tough choice. Often it's a subtle choice and the distinctions between candidates can come down to degrees of ability and often those degrees are very small.
It's not as simple as one person is good and the other is not. I‚Äôve found that communicating those distinctions is virtually impossible.
Like I said, you have a lot to offer, and we just don't see a good fit right now.‚Äù

### Firing
Firing an employee should never be a surprise to either party. Through regular 1:1s, and career discussions you should be aware of what they‚Äôre struggling with and be able to gauge their performance. Be proactive about talking to reports with any performance/behavioral concerns. Waiting for it to go away won‚Äôt help.
If there are concerns you‚Äôve talked to them about and you‚Äôre unable to make headway, it‚Äôs time to gently lead them out. The two recommended options are:
1. **A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**:
A formalized document, signed by both parties, outlining performance concerns and a list of required actions over ~45 days. Required actions would include daily check-ins, no vacation time over that period, `TODO: XXXXXXXXXXXX`. `TODO: Here‚Äôs a link to a template`.
<br>The purpose of the PIP is to cover your (and the company‚Äôs) arse if the employee wants to sue for wrongful dismissal. It‚Äôs unlikely, but the PIP can be successful and help align the employee to higher standards. If they are successful, it's expected that they maintain those higher levels of performance or else they‚Äôre still subject to termination.
1. **Mutual Separation**:
If the employee isn‚Äôt happy with the company or what they‚Äôre working on they might be convinced that they should leave. Your aim here is to give them a comfortable exit, something that they can own. Ideally they‚Äôll give you their notice for a month or so in the future, and you both can plan out what work should be completed by then, so there‚Äôs a clean hand over.

An example conversation around presenting a report with these two options is shown below:
>‚ÄúFor you to be successful here we need to course correct in a big way. Our career discussions were a start, but it's not enough on its own.
<br>I also want to be clear this doesn't reflect on you as a person at all, or on your ability to do good work.
<br>From what you told me the main problem seems to be that what you're working on and what you want to do with your career aren't matching. Would you say that is correct?
<br>Future questions to answer would be "Are you happy here?" and, "Do you like what you're doing?"
<br><br>It seems that there's two paths moving forward:
<br>1. Last week we talked about some action items we could work on to get you back on track. We could do this as a formalized performance improvement plan to course correct, with regular check-ins and terms we both agree to. It's hard work, but I know you're capable of pulling it off if you're committed.
<br>2. The other option stems from you most likely wanting to study early next year. If the role here doesn't align with your career goals/what you want to do, we can talk through what an exit plan may look like that'll work for you and the team.
<br><br>I'm committed to helping you succeed if you want to keep going, but I don't want to throw stuff at you if you're not truly interested.
<br>We'll schedule to meet up again tomorrow afternoon, after you've had some time to think things over.‚Äù

### Warning Order
A Warning Order (WARNO) should be used when there‚Äôs been a major change to existing work plans, that require immediate changes. It‚Äôs a formalized way of reaching out quickly to relevant stakeholders and letting them know about the change so they can help come up with a planned solution, rather than springing it on them hours or days after you found out.
Typical format:
>WARNO: [succinctly state what's changed]
<br>[1 sentence WHY]
<br>[1 sentence HOW - The follow up meeting etc]
