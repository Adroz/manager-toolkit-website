# Congrats, you're now an Engineering Manager!
Let's get to work on getting you up and running with your team.
<br>I think it's safe to assume as a newly minted manager you'll be working with some of your old teammates, or at least within the same company, so this won't focus on building relationships and will assume you know expected practices and tools within your company.

## 1. Set up some recurring meetings
Regularly recurring meetings are great for you and the team. It helps add some routine to your soon-to-be-busy schedule, and won't mess with your directs' deep-cycle work since it's a daily/weekly thing.
1. **Team weekly meeting** - Monday's are great, since it can align you and your team at the beginning of the week. You can spend the time aligning priorities, sharing out upper management messaging and have Product and Design give updates too.
1. **Stand-ups or text-ups** - How do you keep updated with your directs' work, day-to-day? Daily updates mean you get insight into what was accomplished yesterday, and what you expect to see completed by the day's end. Stand-ups get everyone focused on the team's work since you're all communicating in real time, but text-ups are asynchronous meaning you don't pull your directs out of deep work. It's up to you to work with your team to find what works best.
1. **Weekly bug/backlog triage** - This will probably be useful for all new managers. The purpose of this meeting is to get aquatinted with feature and bugs going in and out, and feeding tickets in and out of the backlog. If you have a team of more than 4 people, if you're taking over an existing team, or if you don't have a dedicated QA then it's worth carving out some time for this.

## 2. Evaluate your team communications
Now that you're the manager it's probably worth taking a critical look at how your team communicates.
1. **Team chat** - Do you use Slack/Teams, and do Support/Marketing know where to ask questions? Are you using a single channel for all messaging? I find three channels work for my team: #team-name (Support/Marketing/general questions), #team-name-textup (for text-based stand-ups), and #team-name-eng (engineering discussions in a private channel).
1. **Team emails/calendar** - If your team size is > 5 folks it might be worth it to create email and messaging user groups. It'll make emails, calendar events, and group conversation easier. Also, when you onboard someone new you can just add them in a centralized place and they'll be included in conversations straightaway.
1. **Documents** - How is your team documenting projects that they're working on? Do you have a centralized location for docs? Is there a base template they're all built off, to make parsing them easier? Should your documents be broken down by platform, feature, or discipline?

## 3. Directs
1. **Weekly 1:1s** - Frequent (i.e. weekly) 1:1s are best for creating (and keeping) relationships with your directs. Ad hoc, fortnightly, or monthly meetings are too far apart and you can miss critical work updates, or directs might not feel like you're giving them enough attention.
1. **Set-up a regular performance check-in** - A regular (every ~6 weeks) performance check-in is great for you and the direct. They get guidance on how and where to improve, and you can bring up performance reviews. Come review time, the documentation from your check-ins should help paint a picture of what they've accomplished.
1. **Start tracking vacation time (if HR doesn't do it for you)** - Even with "unlimited" vacation you still want to get a sense for who will be out when. Also, when directs start taking more and more time off, they might be having issues outside of work, or could be bored with their role.

## 4. Think about yourself
1. **Management Philosophy** - Having a management philosophy is a focused way of thinking of your role. It's easy to stay in a reactive mode, but good managers are thinking and planning for the future.
Some good questions to start with are: what is important to you as a manager? What do you wish your manager did, or what should they have done less? What general rules will help you and your team work together and grow?
1. **Carve out some time for yourself** - Block out some time for organizing your notes and thoughts. What works for me is two 1hr blocks. One is my "Office Hours" which, since most people won't use it, means youâ€™ll have some time to consolidate notes on your reports and/or prep for 1:1s/career meetings. Another 1hr I set aside is for my own growth and education.
1. **Managing up** - You're still the direct report of someone, but now you're managing others. You'll need to juggle that with guiding your boss around your needs for growth and development. (pro tip: Use the same career check-in process you have with your reports).
